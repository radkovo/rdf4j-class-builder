# rdf4j-class-builder
Generates Java classes from OWL ontologies. The instances of the generated classes may be easily added to a RDF4J
model and loaded from a model using the corresponding methods that are automatically created by the generator.

The project integrates with the the [RDF4J Vocabulary Builder](https://github.com/radkovo/rdf4j-vocab-builder) project.

*The project is in pre-aplpha state under active development*
